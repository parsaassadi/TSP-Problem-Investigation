# Travelling Salesman Problem Investigation
In this project, two well-known methods are used to generate a solution for TSP, a famous problem in algorithm. A PyQt based GUI is designed for the user to query lon/lat of all cities, and choose one of the approaches (Nearest Neighbor, Exhaustive Search) for solving the problem. The GUI shows the optimum path in a sequential manner (Animated) for the user, and compares the time complexity, and optimality of each of these methods.

We know that Nearest Neighnour is faster, but only gives a sub optimal solution.
